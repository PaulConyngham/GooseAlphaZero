# AlphaZero Tutor: Student Package

Welcome! This folder contains everything you need as a student to follow the AlphaZero interactive RL curriculum.

## Contents
- `syllabus/` — All human-readable lesson material
- `alpha_zero_tutor_recipe.yaml` — Recipe file to load in Goose (CLI or Desktop)
- `README.md` — (This file) — quick setup and usage instructions

## How to Use

1. **Open Goose (CLI or Desktop app)**

2. **Load the recipe:**
   - Desktop/Web: Use the `deeplink` generated by this recipe.
   - CLI: `goose run --recipe alpha_zero_tutor_recipe.yaml --interactive`

3. **Connect to the lesson server.** For most student deployments, this will be a server run by your instructor or coach—*you do not need to run your own backend* unless instructed.

4. **Follow all instructions in Goose!**

If you have technical issues, ask your instructor or refer to the main project documentation.
